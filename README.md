# BlueHat Tech EC2 instance creation shell script!
This shell script creates EC2 instances and, in addition, during the process performs the following tasks:
* Creates group security with rules
* Create a key pair
* Adds tags on Instance, Group Security and instance volumes
* Read a powershall userdata where it change the hostname and administrator password for Windows 2016 or higher

To choose which region the instance will be created in, run <code> aws configure </code>, and specify the region as shown below:

<pre>aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [****************5JKA]:
AWS Secret Access Key [****************WcJ0]:
Default region name [us-east-1]: us-east-2
Default output format [json]: </pre>

See, that I just hit <code> Enter </code> for the first two options, because I already have my AWS connection set up. And I specified <code> us-east-2 </code> as a new region. If you are not yet connected to AWS, search for the <code> aws configure </code> command to see how to establish a connection with AWS.

### Notes:
* Before running this shell script, open the code and try to understand what it does. Change it as needed.
* O userdata aqui Ã© somente para Windows. 

To use this shell script, enter the following commands:
 
<pre>mkdir aws
cd aws
git clone https://github.com/marceloeliassantos/run-ec2
